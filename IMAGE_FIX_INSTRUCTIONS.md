# How to Fix the Missing Images

The images aren't loading from Google Drive because of CORS and authentication restrictions. Here are two solutions:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Solution 1: Download Images Locally (Recommended)**

1. **Go to your Google Drive folder**:
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19xMSHqFGMeaJTtmV8Jud4cxt4_IijZ_o?usp=sharing

2. **Download each image** (1.jpg through 6.jpg):
   - Click on each image file
   - Click the download button (or right-click â†’ Download)
   - Save them with the exact same names: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, 4.jpg, 5.jpg, 6.jpg

3. **Place the images** in the folder:
   `public/images/products/`
   (This folder has been created for you)

4. **Update the code** in `lib/products.ts`:
   - Find line 7: `// return \`/images/products/${filename}\``
   - Uncomment it (remove the //)
   - Comment out line 27: `return \`https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/${fileId}=w1000\``

## ðŸ”„ **Solution 2: Try Different Google Drive URLs**

If you prefer to keep using Google Drive, you can test different URL formats in `lib/products.ts`:

```typescript
// Try uncommenting these one at a time:

// Format 1: Direct view
return `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=${fileId}`

// Format 2: Download
return `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=${fileId}&export=download`

// Format 3: Thumbnail
return `https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=${fileId}&sz=w1000`

// Format 4: Google User Content (currently active)
return `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/${fileId}=w1000`
```

## âœ… **Why Local Images Are Better**

- **Faster loading**: No external requests
- **More reliable**: No CORS issues
- **Better performance**: Optimized by Next.js
- **No rate limits**: Google Drive can throttle requests

The local solution will make your images load instantly and reliably!
